==== Reporting Problems ====

Sometimes translationStudio may not work as expected.\\

At times the program may restart, also called a 'crash'. This is most likely not because of what the translator did. When this happens, the **Feedback** window will open and a request to type into the space an explanation of what was being done just before the program restarted.

At other times, the translator may want to mention a problem with the program or content. For this, go to the Translating Editing Window and tap on the 3 dots found at the bottom left of the window. Choose **Feedback** from the list. Use the keyboard to type in an explanation of the problem that you have been experiencing. 

**Note:** The Feedback option is only available when there is an Internet connection.
