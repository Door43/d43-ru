====== сон ======

===== Определение: =====

Сны - это все то, что люди видят, слышат и переживают в своем разуме, когда спят.

  * В большинстве случаев то, что люди переживают во сне, не происходит в действительности, хотя в момент сна кажется обратное.
  * Иногда Бог дает человеку сон, через который человек должен чему-то научиться. Иногда Бог прямо обращается к людям во снах.
