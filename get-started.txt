>Pray together for us also, that God would open a __door__ for us to speak the word,\\ the mystery of Christ. Because of that word, I am bound. (Colossians __4__:__3__ ULB)

Now that you're ready to translate the Bible, it's time to "open the door" God has provided with the Door43 application. It is surprisingly easy to use, but if you have questions or just want to talk about the app, you can turn to the Door43 user community.

===== Register as a New User =====

Go to the Register as a New User page (see https://door43.org/en/get-started?do=register ) and sign up for an account so you can edit pages.

===== Join the Door43 Community =====

The Door43 community uses Slack to communicate. When you join our slack channels (see https://door43.org/en/slack ) you can learn about the benefits and challenges of this application and share your ideas with the developers as well as other translators. Slack works well in a Browser or you may download a native client for it as well.

===== Learn How to Translate, Check, Publish, and Use Our Tools =====
