===== General Dev Guidelines =====

This is not an exhaustive list but just a few pointers to keep us on the same page.

  * We use Git for managing code (data, too) and usually Github. This makes everyone's life easier. If you need help here, see Github's helpful sites: [[https://help.github.com/|https://help.github.com/]] and [[https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git|https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git]]. See also the Git manual: [[http://git-scm.com/documentation|http://git-scm.com/documentation]].
  * Help on branching: http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/
  * When using Git, commit often, see [[http://blog.crealytics.com/2010/07/09/5-reasons-keeping-git-commits-small-admin/|http://blog.crealytics.com/2010/07/09/5-reasons-keeping-git-commits-small-admin/]].
  * Use existing code whenever possible. If someone has already done what you are trying to do, or even something slightly similar, see if you can use that first (of course check the license).
  * We tend to license our code with a BSD/MIT style license, when possible.  Feel free to copy [[https://github.com/Door43/tools/blob/master/LICENSE|https://github.com/Door43/tools/blob/master/LICENSE]] into new projects.
  * In terms of license assignment and identification, use something very similar to what you see at the top of [[https://github.com/Door43/tools/blob/master/uwb/t4t2dw.py|https://github.com/Door43/tools/blob/master/uwb/t4t2dw.py]].
  * Access to our servers is allowed only via SSH public key authentication to non-root accounts.  If you are on Windows, you'll need PuTTY.  If you are creating a new key, use these options, ''ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096''.


//Information below here may be outdated, YMMV//


===== Open Bible Stories =====

  * **[[:en:dev:obs-app|Open Bible Stories App]]** — //a picture flipboard "ebook" with the text of each segment overlayed over the picture and all of it wrapped in a mobile app. //
  * **[[:en:dev:obs-translation-app|Open Bible Stories Translation App]]** — //an Android (and possibly Chrome(book) extension) that facilitates the translation of Open Bible Stories using a mobile device without requiring Internet access.//
  * **[[:en:dev:obs-book-render|OBS Book Render]]** — //Open Bible Stories starts out as plain text, translated into any language. The text is combined with images on Door43 to create webpages with illustrations. The function of the **OBS Book Render**  utility is to convert the translated text and images into an Open Document file that can be post-processed and printed as a book.//

===== Extending Door43 =====


    * **[[:en:dev:usfmtag|USFMTag]]** — //USFM is an easy way to mark a plain-text file as a translation of the Bible (example: ''<nowiki>\</nowiki>v1 This is the first verse'', ''<nowiki>\</nowiki>v2 this is the second verse''). The USFMTag project enables Bible translations that are marked up with this simple formatting to automatically display as beautiful web pages in Door43.// 
    * **[[:en:dev:tools|Door43 Tools]]** — //Door43 Tools are an extensible set of profiles and utilities (e.g. scripts) that function as a "render engine" to convert and export content in Door43 into various formats for offline use, e.g. PDF, EPUB, DOC, HTML, Mobile apps, etc.// 


===== Other Projects =====

    * **[[:en:dev:obs-video-render|Open Bible Stories video render system]]** – //currently in development by [[http://missionaldigerati.org|Missional Digerati]].//
    * **[[:en:dev:map-creator|Map Creator (for Open Bible Maps)]]** — //What if you had no concept of where Israel is, or Rome, or Egypt, or Galilee, or any of the other places mentioned in the Bible? Imagine how difficult it would be to accurately understand the Bible and the history of Israel. **Open Bible Maps**  makes it possible to rapidly translate high-quality maps of the Bible in any language.//
